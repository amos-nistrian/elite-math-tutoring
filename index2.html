I received a perfect score of 800 on the SAT II Math.  I am passionate about education and enjoy helping others overcome the struggles they encounter with learning so that's why I started Elite Math Tutoring. I have been involved in tutoring others for the past 10 years-helping those from elementary to college level. I have tutored a variety of students varying in level and needs, but the goal has always been the same, to help achieve success through learning. At Elite Math Tutoring, we offer classroom based concept analysis, problem solving and standard test preparation. </p>

                            Cooks really knows his craft. Our son wasn't bad at math, but Cooks really helped him discover his potential. With his unparalleled ability to explain concepts in such a simple way that ensure a true understanding of the material, my son won the math olympiad competition at his school and is now in the double accelerated math program. His ability to learn new topics is much quicker now and his passion and confidence for math just keeps growing. I would highly recommend Cooks for anyone who needs help or inspiration in learning math.

He no longer gets nervous about taking tests and is confident when he sees a problem. I could see from our first session that Cooks is really passionate about helping others with math. 10 out of 10 would recommend Cooks to anyone.

                           Hands down the best parenting decision I made this year was hiring Cooks to tutor my kids. All of my middle-schoolers grades improved as a result of math tutoring from Cooks. The individualized attention in math helped my 8th grader stay on top of all his courses. My elementary-school daughter complains about the work, but loves her successes and is excited about 'above grade level' performance. Call Cooks and get ahead of the curve. Cooks has been an integral part of my sons significant turn-around in academic performance and my daughters new-found enthusiasm for performing above the curve!

                            Cooks started tutoring my twins in 8th grade and they’ve been working with him going on 3 years now. Cooks has a patient but assertive presence that has really helped my kids feel more confident with math. Cooks expands on the math lesson provided by the teacher and he definitely helps them with test prep. Cooks tutors my kids twice a week and both kids feel that he’s essential to their success in math class. We couldn’t imagine working through math class without help from Cooks. I’ve already recommended Cooks to a number of parents and will continue to do so without hesitation!

                            Cooks is an incredible math tutor.  He is smart and clearly loves math. He is able to pass on his excitement and love for math to my kids. He explains things in ways that they can understand and feel empowered to come up with solutions on their own.  Both of my kids feel more confident in their learning and actually are excited after they finish a session.  As a parent, he is also really easy to communicate with and very responsive to feedback.

                            Cooks is a great instructor of mathematics and applied math, e.g., engineering coursework; physics. His understanding of concepts and ability to explain them to others is excellent. He values each student's success and will working with them until he is satisfied they fully understand the material (on a conceptual level, with the ability to apply the knowledge to a wide-variety of problems). 
                            I would highly recommend working with Cooks to students of all levels looking to gain better problem-solving abilities. My time with Cooks translated to increased confidence in and out of the classroom and results on my exams.

                            Cooks is an excellent tutor. He's been working with my kids for about 6 months. He's smart, motivated and loves math. Since working with Cooks, grades have improved. They actually enjoy working with Cooks!

                            Cooks is an awesome math tutor! I would recommend him to anyone needing help in math related courses. Cooks began working with my 9th grade son approximately 1.5 months into his freshman year. My son was getting overwhelmed taking a full load, which included both Algebra and Geometry, and was considering dropping the Geometry course, as was suggested by his guidance counselor. I decided to engage the services of Cooks to see if it could help get our son through the mathematical portion of his freshman course load, and as of the halfway point in the school year my son is successfully learning, making great grades and enjoying both Algebra and Geometry! Without any hesitation I would say that Cooks has been instrumental in helping my son gain confidence, understand clearly, and achieve success in his math course work!

                            Cooks has helped my son immeasurably for the past 2 years with Algebra 2. I approached Cooks initially as my son was failing Algebra and his grades were poor. I knew I needed expert help as my own knowledge of Algebra dates back 30 years or more! Cooks assessed my son’s  level of competence during the first lesson, and was confident he could help. Within a few weeks of working with Cooks, my son’s confidence with his classwork improved and his grades went up. He has maintained an A grade in Algebra in his 9th and 10th grades. My son likes Cooks easy style and patience when he does not understand.    Working online due to COVID 19 has not been a problem.  I am very happy we found Cooks at exactly the right time to help my son.

                            My son Alex moved to the Mercer Island School District in Grade 6 from an international school in Asia.  Cooks has helped Alex with this transition by providing weekly support over the last eighteen months for his Grade 8 Pre-Algebra and Grade 9 Algebra I school classes. Alex has consistently maintained an A grade over this period.  In addition Cooks has been working closely with Alex over the last six months to complete Apex Geometry Honors online.  With Cook's support Alex has obtained an A grade for this online course, which will allow him to move up to accelerated Math next year by skipping over Grade 10 Geometry in school and move straight to Grade 11 Algebra II in tenth grade.  Alex has a good connection with Cooks and is comfortable and proactive in bringing any problems and obstacles he is facing in Math to Cooks.  I plan to have Cooks continuing to support Alex as he continues his Math education in high school.
